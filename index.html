<p> <br>●<em>No Griefing without prior permission. Don’t go around killing people especially
if you don’t know them. if you do end up killing<br> someone accidentally or with
permission, help them get back to their grave<br> to retrieve their inventory.
<p>● Don’t Destroy other players builds or items without prior permission. If you, or
a nearby creeper, destroys something that isn’t yours then you have to fix it to
the best of your ability. If you are unable to fix<br> it then you are to either leave a
sign or book in game or post in the discord what happened. You can also ask
another player for help if any are online at the time, most<br> would be more then
willing to help.
<p>● Pay for items in the Shopping District at the price listed by the owner. If there is
some confusion on what to pay and how much to take you can ask another
online player, post<br> in discord or to check the listed price in the google Docs
page here.
<p>● No Squatting. You are not allowed to move into someone else’s base or builds
without their permission.
If you have any questions about the rules please post them on the discord server or
comment below. <br>Someone will answer you and this page will hopefully be updated to
be more helpful.<em><br></p>
